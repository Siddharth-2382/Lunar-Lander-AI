## Introduction

The Lunar Lander environment is a classic reinforcement learning problem where the goal is to safely land a spacecraft on the moon's surface. In this project, we use deep Q-learning to train an agent to learn optimal actions for successful landings.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1.  Clone this repository:

        git clone https://github.com/Siddharth-2382/Lunar-Lander-AI.git
        cd Lunar-Lander-AI

2.  Install the required dependencies. You can use a virtual environment if desired:

        pip3 install -r requirements.txt

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- OpenAI Gym
- NumPy
- TensorFlow
- Other libraries

## Usage

1. Open `Lunar-Lander-Solved.ipynb` using Jupyter.
2. Run the notebook cells to train the deep Q-learning agent and observe its performance.

## Results

The trained agent demonstrates successful landings in the Lunar Lander environment. You can view a video of the agent's performance in the `videos` directory.
